About
-----
This repository showcases some rather trivial examples of the different SOLID "rules". The packages are seperated into "bad" and "good" subparts where the "bad" part shows how not to do it and the "good" part shows how the design could be improved.

Please note that the structure of the current code does not try to be the optimum, instead it aims to make it as easy as possible to spot the application of the specific principle.

__Pull Requests__ and __comments__ are welcome.
